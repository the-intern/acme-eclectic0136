# Notes

## Partials

> Inheritance (where a template gets or inherits the entire code of the base template
with rights to modify or mutate certain parts), provided by the base template and code
block, is not suitable for code reuse at arbitrary locations on a web page. For that, we need composition, where we have a reusable piece of template code that we can plug in
wherever we want. 

> We can use shortcodes to share snippets of shared functionality in
the markup data, and we can use partials to share common snippets of code in the
templates.

> Partials are function equivalents in standard programming languages, which pro-
vide support for isolating a piece of computation that generates some output to a ren-
dered HTML file and returns some data. Partials take arguments, do some processing
using those arguments, and log data into the output HTML file, returning the compu-
tation results to the caller. Partials are among Hugoâ€™s most important template features,
and understanding the concept of partials is important to being successful with Hugo.
Table 6.1 compares using partials versus base template code for reuse.
